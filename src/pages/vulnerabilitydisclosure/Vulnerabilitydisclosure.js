				<p className={'vulnerabilitydisclosure__text'}>
					We acknowledge that making release available may sometimes take time. It depends on vulnerability severity, its relation to ongoing release work, and areas affected by the issue. We do not attempt to delay issue resolution, but we ensure all necessary modifications of the appropriate quality, resolve the issue, and avoid regressions introduction.

					Public Researcher Rewards Program
					Virtual private networks create encrypted communications and are considered a safe remote access method. Users trust the VPN to keep their sensitive information secure. However, VPNs are attractive targets for hackers, and if the VPN gets compromised, the attackers can get full access to all the personal data that was meant to remain anonymous.
					It is remotely exploitable vulnerabilities that would allow a hacker to gain unauthorized access to the VPN, that is why it is crucial for us to discover previously unknown security holes in our products and services to make sure you can keep using <span className={'mail-app-text'}>(APP NAME)</span> as a reliable and trusted way to access sensitive resources. We encourage vulnerability researchers and users to find flaws in our software and report them directly to us so we could fix them before a hacker exploits them.
					The Public Researcher Rewards program aims to reward top-performing security researchers that help make our services better and keep our users safe. Through this program, we reward vulnerability researchers who look into our products' security and invest their time and effort in helping us make <span className={'mail-app-text'}>(APP NAME)</span> more secure. To honor cutting-edge contributors, we provide various bonuses and rewards, the level of which is based on the bug severity.
